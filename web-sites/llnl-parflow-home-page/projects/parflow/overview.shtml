<H2>Background</H2>
Groundwater contamination is a major environmental problem throughout
the world. In the United States, for instance, numerous governmental
and industrial sites require remediation. The Department of Energy is  
currently cleaning up several of its contaminated facilities, including the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). 
<P>

At LLNL, chemical solvents and petroleum products were dumped onto the 
ground surface in the 1940s when the present site was a naval air station. 
LLNL is obligated to characterize the contamination and clean it up. Toward this 
end, various engineered remediation techniques (e.g., pump-and-treat and 
biofilters) are now being studied, tested, and implemented. 
<P>

<STRONG> Contaminants have migrated through the unsaturated zone into 
the more mobile groundwaters. 
LLNL is designing and implementing remediation procedures.
</STRONG>
<P>
To understand better the efficacy of a given cleanup strategy, as well
as to determine the most economical implementation for a specific
site, engineers frequently employ mathematical modeling tools to aid
in their analysis and design of remediation procedures. Unfortunately,
many models are based on unrealistic assumptions about the subsurface
media and its flow behavior. For example, many models 
ignore the fact that the subsurface is heterogeneous in composition
and in spatial distribution. These simple homogeneous models are
incapable of capturing important physical phenomena (such as
fingering) that have a significant impact on contaminant migration.  
<P>
Another flaw of many models is that they employ outdated and
inefficient numerical methods, which preclude running realistic
simulations on even the largest conventional vector supercomputers. Consequently, 
remediation strategies based on these simplistic models often perform poorly 
(e.g., miss the plume or take too long to clean it up). To compensate, site 
managers over-engineer the remediation process, which increases costs. 
<P>
To address these deficiencies, we are developing ParFlow, a simulator for
modeling fluid flow through heterogeneous porous media. To enable
detailed simulations of large sites, this code uses the latest
numerical methods and high-performance computing technologies. 
These simulations provide site managers with a more realistic picture of contaminant migration, thereby enabling a more cost-effective cleanup strategy.
<P>
<H2>
Enabling Detailed Simulations
</H2>

The ParFlow simulator is being used to study groundwater flow and contaminant
migration at several sites, including LLNL. The size of these sites (usually sev
eral
square kilometers) and the need to resolve the subsurface heterogeneities (to wi
thin
a few meters) result in grids with more than one million spatial zones.
<p>
Since one never has this much hard data about the subsurface composition, we
employ geostatistical techniques to generate statistically accurate subsurface r
ealizations
from the given field data. We then discretize the modeling equations and solve t
he
resulting linear system with a multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradient algor
ithm.
This yields the flow velocity field, which is then passed to an advection code t
o simulate
contaminant migration. At present, we have the option of using a particle-in-cel
l code
with reactive chemistry or a grid-based Godunov method.
<p>
As seen in the <a href="simulations.shtml">simulations</a>, the heterogeneities lead to
complicated flow paths, which result in the rapid spreading of the plume.
Unlike other codes, the ParFlow simulator is capable of capturing these
important effects.
<H2>
Portable and Scalable
</H2>

The ParFlow simulator is portable across a variety of computing platforms, rangi
ng from workstations to massively parallel computers. Most of our simulations ar
e run on the CRAY T3D, but we also have run on the IBM SP-1, nCUBE/2, SGI Onyx,
and a cluster of Sun Sparcstations. We have demonstrated scalability on each of
the MPP platforms, which means that our code makes efficient use of the addition
al processors needed for bigger simulations. Our solver is especially fast: we h
ave solved realistic flow problems involving eight million spatial zones in just
 13 seconds on a 256-processor CRAY T3D.
<p>
<H2>Graphical User Interface</H2>

We are developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance ParFlow's 
ease-of-use. This GUI allows the user to define the subsurface conceptual model (via the Army's 
<a href="http://www.et.byu.edu/~geos/software/gms/gms.html">GMS package</a>), 
to specify pumping wells and other input parameters (via pop-up windows), 
and to visualize the results (via <a href="http://www.avs.com">AVS</a> or Explorer), as well as to customize the simulator and machine configurations.
<p>
This GUI runs on a variety of platforms, which makes it easier for users to move
from one machine to another. For example, an engineer can run preliminary
simulations on an in-house workstation and then run detailed simulations on a
remote MPP, without knowing anything about the underlying architecture.
